1. Incident commander name:
Monero crypto mining container
- Minergate through kubectl command
- Monerpool through kubectl command 
2. Executive Summary of what happened:
- Abnormalities was detected on Falco-exporter where mount launched in privileged container and event rate have a sudden spike from 0.05 to 0.1 (double of the event rate)
- CPU utilisation abnormalities double from average 30% to 61%. 
3. Summary of what was affected:
- Resources of system node being consumed by illegal activities and causing timeout. 
- Sudden spike of resources usage causes response of the cluster to be delayed (increase in latency).
4. Summmary of the impact:
- Unauthorised mounted activites on cluster affect resources consumption like CPU utilization for kubernetes and default namespace.
- Cryptomining consumes a lot of CPU and leads to potential latency in response.
5. Summary of the remediation steps:
- Immediate removal of unauthorized cluster activities and any consistent resources consumption that was not identify or deem to be legitimate.
- Harden cluster node through hardening step with baseline hardening.
- Scan on vulnerability from libraries and dependencies using static analysis/dynamic analysis.
- Ensure all images deploy is scanned through image layer analysis using tools like grype.
6. Summary of lessons learned:
- Use abnormalities as a case study to deploy detection like grafana dashboard using certain threshold setting to send notification for team to review any abnormal behaviour on the system node.
- Implement hardening and screening whenever new code and image is deploy and implement to ensure less possible attack can be done on the cluster node.
